                    the landscape changes dramatically; it is truly astonishing to see the mountains, snow, cold desert,
                    alpine meadows and lakes at a short distance from each other. Tourism in Ladakh is an absolute

                        when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its
                        design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. </li>

            <div class="data" id="data6">
                <p>Meghalaya, alongside neighbouring Indian states, has been of archaeological interest. People have
                    lived in Meghalaya since the Neolithic period. Neolithic sites discovered so far are located in
                    areas of high elevation in Khasi Hills, Garo Hills and in neighbouring states, where Neolithic style
                    jhum or shifting cultivation is practiced even today.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Living Root Bridge</b> are one of Meghalaya’s most
                        beautiful tangible heritage sites. These sites have recently been added to the UNESCO world
                        heritage site list. They are made of intertwined roots which are a sort of magic, but they
                        aren’t imaginary. These bridges have been built for centuries by the indigenous people of the
                        land</li>
                    <li><b>Laitlum Canyon</b> is open for visits throughout the year. But if you are
                        not a seasoned trekker, it’s advisable to not undertake the hike during the monsoon season as
                        the heavy rainfall makes for a perilous climb. You must take extra care to look out for the
                        slippery steps at the summit. However, you should make sure that you reach the summit or the
                        adjoining village well before 5 PM since it is dangerous to be out on the trails after that
                        time.</li>
